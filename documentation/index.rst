Welcome to the Balancing Valorisation Platform (BVP) documentation!
===================================================================

In a world with renewable energy, balancing is crucial. Planning ahead allows flexible assets to profit from balancing,
by scheduling the best **balancing actions** (such as shifting or curtailing energy use).

The *Balancing Valorisation Platform (BVP)* is a tool for scheduling balancing actions on behalf of the connected asset owners.
Its purpose is to offer these balancing actions as one aggregated service to energy markets, realising the highest possible value for its users.

It fulfills this purpose with four services:

* Automation
* Insight
* Autonomy
* Profit sharing

For more on BVP services, read :ref:`services`.

The BVP is compliant with the `Universal Smart Energy Framework (USEF) <https://www.usef.energy/>`_.
Therefore, this documentation uses USEF terminology, e.g. for role definitions.
The intended platform operator of the BVP is a Supplier. Asset owners are referred to as Prosumers.
