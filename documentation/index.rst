Welcome to the BVP's documentation!
===================================

The Balancing Valorisation Platform (BVP) is a multi-user web application for scheduling balancing actions from a diverse set of assets. The system allows aggregators and asset owners to monitor power consumption and production as well as relevant price data. In addition, the system uses algorithms for machine learning and control strategies to assist human operators with forecasts and decision-making.
