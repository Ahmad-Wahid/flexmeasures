Services of the Balancing Valorisation Platform
**************************************************

Automation
-------------

The BVP provides decision-making support so that the platform operator can schedule balancing actions.
It forecasts the state of assets and proposes the best balancing actions (shifting or curtailment)
for future periods that need actions. This is done with modern forecasting and scheduling intelligence.

Insight
--------------
Both platform operator and asset owners can monitor the assets - past and current states as well as forecasts are displayed numerically in plots and tables.
Balancing actions ordered in the past can be reviewed.
Proposed and scheduled balancing actions show their expected effects (on imbalance as well as on financial returns).

Autonomy
--------------
The companies connected to the BVP only give up as much control as necessary. The asset owners still control the main behaviour of their assets.
The owners allow the platform operator to schedule balancing actions within limits they can set.
Finally, the platform operator can choose to approve all proposed balancing actions manually or to let the BVP automatically schedule them.

Profit sharing
---------------
The platform operator and asset owners share the profit made from balancing actions between them.
The BVP provides basic accounting.
